Overview
========
This is a starter project using jax-rs / jersey.  I've created this because I often find myself wanting to expirement with something that needs a webservice, and this gives me a starting spot.  Clone or fork and use as needed.

How-to run
==========
1) Compile
The project compiles using gradle.  If you already have gradle installed, compile using:
```
gradle war
```

If you do not have gradle install, you can utilize the gradle wrapper included in the source
  ./gradlew war

The war file is compile to:
  build/libs/jersey-starterkit.war

2) Deploy the war file to web container.  I've been using apache-tomcat [http://tomcat.apache.org], and typically copy the war to the tomcat webapps directory.  On my machine:
  cp build/libs/jersey-starterkit.war /Applications/apache-tomcat-6.0.33/webapps/

3) Confirm that it is running by fetching the URL at on webcontainer + /jersey-helloworld/rest/hello.  On my machine:
  curl localhost:8080/jersey-helloworld/rest/hello
